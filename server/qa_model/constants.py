CONTEXT = "My name is Samraj Moorjani. \
    I am a sophomore in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \
    My primary interests lie in natural language processing and understanding the underlying \
    nuances in how we communicate through language.\
    Currently I am working with the Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research on \
    creating a sparse language model to test our sparse matrix multiplication kernel on. \
    This next semester I will be taking computational advertising, deep learning, and system programming. \
    I am proficient in Python, C++, CUDA, Java, JS, TS, MATLAB, and Scala. \
    I have experience working with machine learning libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, SciKit-Learn, and more. \
    I have worked with database tools like SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. \
    Some of the full-stack tools I know include GraphQL, Flask, React, URQL, Apollo, Redis, Next.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, and JQuery. \
    I am also familiar with other technologies like AWS EC2, Docker, Git, Batch, Shell, LaTeX, and more."
