                <p>I am a freshman in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                I am interested in the study of intelligence and how we can replicate it through computers.
                I enjoy understanding the nuances and underlying meanings in how we communicate and I'd like to pursue a career in NLP.
                I have experience with multiple deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) along with database tools (SQL, MongoDB, etc.), web frameworks (React, Bootstrap, etc.), and more.
